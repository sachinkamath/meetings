17:16:41 <basee_> btwn there were sm issues last year once @banas tld that poornima tld they couldn't wear it
17:16:45 <basee_> sm thing blah blah
17:16:46 <banas> you'll need to know how to market though ;)
17:16:47 <nikam> brooklyn: LoL
17:16:47 <basee_> any issues?
17:16:58 <banas> Let me give you some tshirt gyan
17:17:04 <nikam> alright
17:17:08 <banas> 1) Collect money in advance, start collecting money today
17:17:14 <banas> okay lets make this info
17:17:20 <banas> # topic tshirt gyan
17:17:27 <banas> #topic tshirt gyan
17:17:40 <banas> #info 1) Collect money in advance, start collecting money today
17:17:49 <basee_> let us put up 200 as advance for both tshirt n band
17:17:53 <banas> #info 2) Make sure to cater for girl sizes
17:17:53 <basee_> is dat fyn all??
17:18:10 <nikam> let banas finish
17:18:23 <banas> #info 3) Choose gray/white for primary color, they're cheaper.
17:18:55 <banas> #info 4) Don't use a dark color for the main graphic, when it fades it becomes more apparent
17:19:10 <banas> #info 5) Crew names on the back is cool, but costs money so plan in advance
17:19:44 <basee_> +1
17:19:51 <banas> #info 6) This is when the first year's are most clueless about stuff, so if you want to sell overpriced stuff to make the college money, this is the time
17:20:02 <suriya> @banas... U are awesome man.. (Y)
17:20:05 <banas> #info 7) Keep bills for everything, because people will ask.
17:20:10 <banas> that's all :)

17:20:32 <banas> #undo
17:20:32 <glitterfox> Removing item from minutes: <MeetBot.ircmeeting.items.Info object at 0x1ad4d50>
17:20:46 <banas> #info 6) This is when the first year's are most clueless about stuff, so if you want to sell overpriced stuff to make the club money, this is the time
17:20:53 <banas> #info 7) Keep bills for everything, because people will ask.
17:21:00 <banas> yep, good luck!
17:21:03 <nikam> okay guys, amount to be paid
17:21:13 <gameface22> 200 will do?

17:21:28 <basee_> i wl tl u nxt week
17:21:31 <basee_> is dat fyn?
17:21:54 <nikam> for tshirt and bands??
17:22:00 <banas> You don;t want the most active folk paying more money when they're putting in time + money
17:22:15 <basee_> brooklyn design posters for tshirt marketing too
17:22:55 <banas> #action basee_ Report quotes for tshirt and bands
17:22:55 <brooklyn> @ banas +1
17:22:55 <nikam> banas: but initially? we need tshirts for induction right?
17:23:11 <banas> nikam: I don;t follow
17:23:22 <basee_> is everyone fyn with last year's design if no wat change u need?
17:23:38 <banas> basee_: of course change the design! why would you reprint the same tshirt!
17:23:44 <brooklyn> lets make it grey\
17:23:50 <nikam> we need some initial funding for the crew shirts + bands before we can sell some, where do we get that from?
17:23:56 <banas> oh by quotes I mean, price btw
17:24:10 <banas> nikam: that's what you'll pay right now
17:24:19 <basee_> @banas can u ask jeevitha maam for the intial fund??
17:24:19 <banas> and get back later once they're sold
17:24:32 <nikam> so how much should that be?
17:24:37 <banas> basee_: you're the treasurer ;)
17:24:38 <basee_> dult advised me not to go for that
17:24:40 <banas> see, do this
17:24:44 <banas> this is what i did last time
17:24:45 <basee_> first to take orders in hand
17:24:55 <basee_> yepp
17:24:56 <banas> ok, ill add more info wait
17:25:20 <banas> #info 8) Make people pay more if they're going to pay for tshirts once they receive it
17:25:39 <brooklyn> nice
17:25:40 <banas> lol, ironically, it converted to the 8) smiley :D
17:25:51 <banas> so those who pay advance, pay 320 for a tshirt
17:25:59 <banas> those who pay later, pay 420
17:26:02 <nikam> yup
17:26:10 <nikam> + bands?
17:26:12 <basee_> lol
17:26:28 <nikam> lets make it 350, we'll recover it later?
17:26:43 <banas> no this is not exact value. I was giving an example
17:26:52 <banas> exact value depends on basee_ 's quotes
17:26:53 <nikam> alright
17:26:59 <gameface22> banas: bands/stickers?
17:27:09 <nikam> basee_ : what do you think should be the price?
17:27:11 <banas> bands are cheap. I think you'll have to put that along with tshirt
17:27:27 <basee_> -_-
17:27:45 <gameface22> cool then
17:27:46 <banas> I think you should be able to get tshirts for 150 a piece if you search around
17:27:49 <banas> but do it quick
17:27:54 <nikam> basee_ : quote it soon, its ur job to get the tshirts and band ready for the show
17:28:00 <basee_> i need to enquire for more cheaper ones with gameface22 n madhusudhanan
17:28:16 <nikam> when can you tell the price?
17:28:18 <basee_> yepp
17:28:24 <banas> yep, go to Tirupur man. that's where the stuff is
17:28:25 <basee_> next meetup frm colg

17:28:56 <brooklyn> anybody here knows madan raj well enough?
17:29:04 <banas> unless they make me run for some kind of placement, works for me

18:03:19 <SuriyA_> :D !
18:03:23 <nikam> yeah
18:03:24 <brooklyn> that is nice, but it should be well disguised so that the amrita ppl dont realise we are talking about wifi
18:03:35 <nikam> so anchors for the show
18:03:38 <banas> yep, what is wifi called in sanskrit?
18:03:43 <nikam> me-sambhav-lekha

18:05:54 * banas observes Monelilly sounds like a good name for a software project
18:06:01 <nikam> so he'll be in the audience , catching first years in between, or crack some jokes on the anchors to make it more lively
18:06:10 <mone> lol

18:11:55 <nikam> pinged him
18:12:00 <brooklyn> nice, we ll ask lilly t oget us admission in bangalore
18:12:46 <brooklyn> and bangalore has better canteens, with something called as cocacola and pepsi
18:13:05 <brooklyn> anyways, is ahuja joining us?
18:13:13 <nikam> nope
18:13:28 <brooklyn> he s not online?
18:13:30 <gameface22> yes ahuja said he is planning
18:13:41 <gameface22> no
18:13:42 <nikam> if that happens, we can have some funny skit about teachers and students - like we had in our CSE induction?
18:14:09 <nikam> it was really awesome
18:14:16 <brooklyn> but im kinda of the feeling that somebody needs to accompany ahuja
18:14:38 <brooklyn> one skit, one guy, too much workload?
18:14:50 <gameface22> who will act in the skit
18:15:04 <mone> r we doing skit
18:15:10 <brooklyn> probably
18:15:13 <nikam> yes

18:16:41 <nikam> see, we have couple of good actors in my class, i can help  join you with them
18:16:55 <brooklyn> but remember, traditionally, skits in amrita has been the cause of boredom unless it s in malayalam, so it should be funny and not mokai, what say guys?
18:17:04 <mone> okay
18:17:23 <nikam> you didn't see the last year skit for our induction
18:17:29 <nikam> it was awesome
18:17:51 <brooklyn> no actually ,probably cos im in IT dept -_-
18:18:01 <brooklyn> oh, what was it about?
18:18:09 <mone> was it abt that interview one
18:18:14 <mone> ???

18:23:15 <nikam> ahuja doesn't seem to be interested
18:23:16 <nikam> :(

18:23:16 <gameface22> he is not active noe

18:23:21 <mone> i think hw is interested
18:23:38 <mone> ya he will be happy to do
18:23:38 <brooklyn> ok, i think this one with interviews viva s etc has potential for catching the attention of first years
18:23:40 <banas> I think he's worked on something as well, call him up sometime
18:23:57 <banas> just make sure you guys review it, so it isn;t too serious
18:24:42 <nikam> yeah
18:24:56 <nikam> no point doing a really serious play
18:25:02 <brooklyn> +1
18:25:08 <nikam> if it doesn't happen - mone u take it up
18:25:13 <brooklyn> no need to do a serious play at all
18:27:28 <nikam> we need some one to give a talk
18:27:28 <brooklyn> sarup, ur up
18:27:28 <nikam> baas: a super senior - if he comes, you or one of us. One talk on tech stuff
18:27:28 <nikam> *sorry , banas
18:27:30 <brooklyn> GO banas!!
18:28:09 <brooklyn> We can even have Adi sir along with banas and yeshwanth if he comes?
18:28:25 <gameface22> brooklyn: +1
18:28:33 <banas> I'm sorry guys, I probably won't be around for Induction :(
18:28:34 <gameface22> Adi sir is really good.
18:28:59 <banas> But I trust you guys can do a talk easily - enough content delivered walking with you :P
18:29:14 <gameface22> banas is the expert :P
18:30:11 <banas> call adi sir
18:30:28 <banas> #topic Talks
18:30:29 <nikam> banas - guru _/\_ - ur call , one talk will be enough
18:30:43 <banas> #action banas Invite Adi sir
18:31:28 <brooklyn> why we also have a recorded video for banas?
18:32:01 <brooklyn> im sorry , i mean why not we also have a recorded video for banas?
18:33:12 <banas> nah dude, please someone else! :P
18:33:28 <banas> I mean, please, someone else
18:34:45 <nikam> brooklyn - one talk will be enough, 0. intro video 1. we have a skit 2. a dance 3. a slide thing to cover our activites  4. slide - for why we are awesome than other clubs,
18:34:45 <nikam> 4. a talk
18:34:45 <nikam> sorry
18:34:51 <nikam> 5. recorded chat
18:34:53 <brooklyn> i think we need an inspirational talk like what adi sir gave instead of a pure tech talk
18:34:54 <gameface22> 5.things we are doing in the future
18:34:59 <brooklyn> what say
18:34:59 <nikam> 6. a tech talk
18:35:09 <gameface22> and introduction about events
18:35:09 <nikam> 6 things are enough for an hour
18:35:33 <brooklyn> i mean they are first years, they may not understand most of it
18:35:46 <brooklyn> ya 6 things are enough
18:35:48 <banas> nikam: is it just an hour?
18:36:05 <nikam> maybe 1 and a half?
18:36:10 <nikam> depends on the 7 items
18:36:11 <banas> yeh probably
18:36:20 <banas> you should have called vipin sir too
18:36:35 <nikam> 7 will be good -> crisp and quality items
18:37:05 <nikam> yeah, i dont think what the fark songwill be digested well then
18:37:14 <brooklyn> actually the slides, intro video,are just fillers man
18:38:11 <nikam> no, we will be speaking on it! see more the items, it  gets more boring
18:38:14 <banas> #idea Get people on IRC during the induction is possible, we can then have more people join us from early on
18:38:21 <brooklyn> the skit, dance, chat, talk are the only main time consuming items
18:38:47 <banas> I can do the into to foss session on IRC one weekend when many people are on :)
18:38:49 <gameface22> banas: they won't have laptops
18:39:09 <brooklyn> ya the irc thing is a great idea, except that few will have smart phones there right?
18:40:09 <brooklyn> we can have twitter feeds
18:40:09 <gameface22> smart phones + Internet connection
18:40:09 <brooklyn> but still depends on no of smart phones
18:40:09 <gameface22> we will have the IRC part when we conduct workshops
18:40:09 <banas> yeh, that's one problem - but try to do what you can.
18:40:13 <banas> might be a bit "involving" for the audience too :)
18:40:20 <brooklyn> and who all are interested to tweet or text in case the induction is really interesting and eye catching
18:40:53 <nikam> yes, agreed!
18:40:54 <nikam> we can include it in our notice too!
18:41:07 <brooklyn> we can have the tweet or irc part
18:41:13 <nikam> bring ur smart phones with internet too have some fun :p ?
18:41:15 <brooklyn> ya we can include, but how
18:41:55 <brooklyn> ya and then get expelled in the beginning of your college
18:42:48 <banas> lol
18:43:08 <brooklyn> remember how we were hunted in first year for having phones which have more than a calling feature
18:43:39 <nikam> banas: U think we should have more events?
18:44:11 <nikam> I feel 5-6 good items will be enough to catch them?
18:44:19 <banas> I don't think you';ll need more events, but you'll need more fillers definitely
