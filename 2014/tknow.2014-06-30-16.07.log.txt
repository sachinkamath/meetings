17:42:32 <banas> I'm kinda stuck with the tickets.
17:42:45 <nikam> everyone's introduction on stage can be like that!
17:43:01 <basee> wth a yellow band !!!
17:43:07 <nikam> we were just discussing an idea of introducing all the core members on the stage in a fun way
17:44:37 <banas> nice :D
17:44:40 <banas> contrinue :)
17:44:48 <make> +1
17:45:58 <Suriya> @banas... What are the diff areas of the club?
17:46:49 <sarmishta> finding gud background instrumentals is another job for us nw for 1.Advertising video 2.Introducing core crew 3.Fun at tknow
17:47:18 <sarmishta> so we need to start searching for different catchy & enthusiastic genres too !!
17:47:47 <nikam> and for the video - @banas - any weird ideas? where wecan make it more awesome? i was thinking showing things like people developing robots, ICPC Coding, awesome alumni's, meetings in the lawn, hangers etc in the video?
17:48:04 <banas> yes that sounds neat!
17:48:11 <banas> ask anirudh he may have ideas
17:48:27 <Suriya> Yeah cool...;)
17:48:42 <abhishek> we could do a timelapse 'day in a geek's life'
17:48:47 <nikam> yes, if he helps - it would be awesome. @banas, will he be free?
17:48:59 <basee> anirudh is here at colg

17:51:12 <banas> I don't sorry!
17:51:20 <basee> ohkk
17:51:29 <sarmishta> In the video We should also give them some enthu by telling abt the fun to tinker with the system & play with it by changing the settings :D
17:52:18 <sarmishta> thats the way we can invite them to join us to the open source world !
17:52:58 <nikam> hmm... we need people taking  up the job. Who's taking it up? video part? You don't have to do it yourself but make sure it happens! and is awesome
17:54:17 <abhishek> i spoke to anirudh
17:54:24 <abhishek> some days back
17:54:39 <abhishek> he's currently caught up with summer courses
17:54:47 <abhishek> says he doesnt have much time
17:55:06 <abhishek> but he'll be able to pitch in once coll starts (maybe)
17:55:11 <nikam> maybe some one else?
17:55:31 <sarmishta> so,Lets try to make some effort before he joins us !
17:57:38 <sarmishta> I think we need to take up an initiative thou none of us is an expert in this job..only then, they can beautify it !!
17:57:45 <nikam> guys i am tired, some other day for now? But we really need more participation and some firm descisions
17:57:49 <sarmishta> in a short time with us
