12:25:57 <nikam> LoL
12:26:10 <dultinator> I don't think anything > 100 bucks should be used for prizes. Ever.

12:28:01 <_basil> becuase we dont hav any fund s of now
12:28:11 <dultinator> And if you're serious about making bands, zero in on a place.
12:28:22 <dultinator> _basil brought up stickers the other day.
12:28:27 <nikam> How do we go about that?
12:28:29 <banas> one option, make caps/bands. they're unisex and have fairly universal sizes
12:28:38 <dultinator> banas, think we could get a stickystamp discount? :P
12:28:46 <_basil> bought?
12:28:46 <banas> dultinator: wristbands
12:28:52 <nikam> yeah, caps is good idea!
12:29:08 <romil931> Wristbands
12:29:17 <dultinator> banas: I know, but ask them to zero in on a good place.
12:29:30 <ravi_> caps sounds nice. but ppl rarely use..
12:29:31 <romil931> It will look stupid wearing caps in amriteshwari hall

12:46:08 <_basil> dult said jeevitha maam gave about 2K last year
12:46:13 <anchal> Since we are so many we can give some contribution
12:46:20 <nikam> so lets do that again, we have more people now!
12:46:20 <anchal> Hope that will work
12:46:35 <ravi_> no.. entrance fee is very bad.

12:51:59 <amaragayathri> #vote everyonepays
12:52:02 <banas> ok, so is there more to discuss on this area? would you like to move this for later?
12:52:03 <Aiswarya> Lol
12:52:07 <Z_E_U_S> and if entry fees is 10 rs and a sufficient audience, think how much we can raise? @banas
12:52:11 <nikam> yup
12:52:35 <romil931> Enough for wristbands i guess and stickers maybe
12:52:39 <banas> Z_E_U_S: we did 30 bucks, we raised enough for a party after the event :)
12:52:46 <_basil> lets put up 100 bucks each is dat fyn
12:53:05 <Z_E_U_S> guys u make not like me for saying that, but try to see from all points of view
12:54:06 <_basil> no entrance fee for an induction programme that too in the vry first week of freshers
12:54:06 <nikam> Did anyone think of some awesome activity for the event?
12:54:06 <_basil> pls
12:54:21 <Z_E_U_S> 30 bucks anyone is fine with, and a good no can genrate a lot for anything as banas says
12:54:50 <nikam> yes, we can charge them - provided our induction is awesome!
12:55:00 <Z_E_U_S> exactly
12:55:02 <_basil> ask madhu because he s the one dealing with bands or stickers or wat eve it is
12:55:03 <Z_E_U_S> so its on us
12:55:04 <banas> Here's what I suggest
12:55:11 <banas> Keep a free induction
12:55:20 <banas> do a charged workshop as follow up
12:55:22 <Z_E_U_S> either we take the easy way out, but pening our wallets, or the contrary
12:55:23 <nchal> +1
12:55:34 <amaragayathri> thats the best idea !
12:55:39 <Z_E_U_S> opening*
12:55:41 <BlakeRazor> thats a good idea...
12:55:47 <Z_E_U_S> ya that ll work too
12:55:52 <_basil> +1
12:55:53 <Aiswarya> +1
12:56:12 <varuns55> +1
12:56:21 <The_> +1
12:56:23 <Sriram> +1
12:56:35 <ravi_> cool. Not bad. +1
12:56:53 <nikam> ok then, we'll go ahead with saup's idea :)
12:57:09 <Z_E_U_S> yes im up for it
12:57:44 <nchal> M
12:57:51 <Z_E_U_S> instead of giving swag in induction, give it to somebody who ll deserve it in the workshop
12:58:03 <banas> #idea free beer induction, paid beer follow up workshop
12:58:11 <Z_E_U_S> and that will come from a minimal amt from anybody else
12:58:28 <Z_E_U_S> everyone*
12:58:51 <romil931> Makes sense +1
12:58:56 <Z_E_U_S> ya but a lot will depend on the success of induction
12:59:12 <amaragayathri> also i wud like suggest not to assign the jobs just like that to ppl may be making a poster or a video watever !! Doing any job as a team together wud be better !
12:59:41 <Z_E_U_S> there will be chaos then
12:59:42 <nikam> But still assigning people will be better, we can catch hold of them later
12:59:56 <Z_E_U_S> exactly
12:59:57 <banas> amaragayathri: of course, but do give responsibiliies, or there's no one to blame ;)
13:00:15 <amaragayathri> thats fair :) then time to start assigning !!
13:00:23 <nikam> who's up for the poster? @banas , Z_E_U_S ?
13:00:34 <banas> wait is this discussion over?
13:00:44 <banas> you'll thank me later for doing an organized meeting :)
13:00:45 <Z_E_U_S> no
13:00:52 <nikam> :P
13:00:52 <banas> then finish this first
13:01:00 <amaragayathri> sure
13:01:12 <nikam> Ok, where were we?
13:01:25 <Z_E_U_S> y are ppl leaving ?
13:01:32 <Aiswarya> Money problem
13:02:02 <Aiswarya> It's becoz there net is not working
13:02:15 <nikam> ok- we pay for the start, then earn it up with workshops?
13:02:21 <amaragayathri> take it easy..go on !! network probs
13:02:32 <Z_E_U_S> i know its crazy, but putting a lot of our hopes on the induction can be dangerous
13:02:34 <Z_E_U_S> !
13:02:37 <Z_E_U_S> !!!
13:02:37 <glitterfox> I don't know, Z_E_U_S.
13:02:38 <Z_E_U_S> !
13:03:24 <Z_E_U_S> i knw its crazy , but can we have a simple but fun workshop b4 induction,like a what is linux or something?
13:03:35 <nikam> @banas,- we'll have a vote for a paid/ free  induction?
13:03:39 <romil931> If it leaves even a slight wrong notion then the club will have issues with future endevours
13:03:57 <Z_E_U_S> ya
13:04:08 <Z_E_U_S> thats y im asking for a workshop first
13:04:13 <Z_E_U_S> !

13:04:43 <Z_E_U_S> !
13:04:53 <banas> Z_E_U_S: just speak :)
13:05:19 <Z_E_U_S> if we have a workshop b4 induction, it ll be better
13:05:19 <Z_E_U_S> because
13:05:26 <vishaag> #vote no
13:05:47 <Z_E_U_S> we will give an impression that we are ready to give
13:05:48 <_basil> #vote no
13:05:52 <Z_E_U_S> to reach i mean
13:06:08 <Z_E_U_S> teach and reach out i mean
13:06:19 <The_> #vote no
13:06:24 <Z_E_U_S> then we can get a gud audience for induction
13:06:24 <varuns55> #vote no
13:06:32 <_basil> c can @banas go for a pyton or fedora workshop and ask them to donate smthng for that (i meant wl fedora giv monet like dat?)
13:06:32 <Z_E_U_S> whch can be free
13:06:52 <Z_E_U_S> induction can be free
13:06:52 <ravi_> Dude.! do you think ppl will attend workshop in 1st week itself./?
13:06:58 <nikam> Z_E_U_S: but first years come by 1 august, out induction is around 12? Will we have time between that?
13:07:10 <nikam> ravi_ : right
13:07:22 <nikam> #vote no
13:07:30 <romil931> #vote no
13:07:39 <ravi_> #vote no
13:07:42 <amaragayathri> #vote NO
13:07:57 <Z_E_U_S> but the workshop b4 induction can get like a gud no of ppl to advertise about the induction later on
13:08:22 <Z_E_U_S> directly pinning all our hopes on the induction can be fatal
13:08:29 <Z_E_U_S> for the future
13:08:30 <banas> _basil: I'm against that personally. that money wll go to swag, then how is that raising anything for inductions?
13:08:39 <banas> #vote no
13:08:46 <Sriram> @ Z_E_U_S   also organizing the workshop and the induction within a span of one month(after the college starts) would be hectic.We need to have all plans in hand to be able to do both successfully.
13:08:52 <_basil> ooohkkk  @banas
13:08:59 <Sriram> #vote no
13:09:38 <anchal> #vote no
13:09:39 <Z_E_U_S> @ banas ??
13:10:06 <Z_E_U_S> a  "what is linux?'
13:10:07 <banas> Z_E_U_S: depends on what you're doing the workshop on
13:10:07 <Z_E_U_S> is ot that hard
13:10:07 <nikam> Sriram:  right . We can have the induction first - and then go for the workshop in the same month :)
13:10:30 <Z_E_U_S> what is linux is not that hard to do?
13:10:48 <Z_E_U_S> or its completely wrong to call it a workshop
13:11:13 <Z_E_U_S> its like gettig started with basic tech
13:11:30 <nikam> !
13:11:37 <nikam> everyone's voted?
13:11:43 <Z_E_U_S> its like gettig started with basic tech
13:11:47 <Z_E_U_S> or its completely wrong to call it a workshop
13:11:53 <Z_E_U_S> or forget it if this doesnt work well with u guys
13:12:08 <Z_E_U_S> #vote no
13:12:45 <banas> Z_E_U_S: im not sure how catchy that is to someone who just came out of school
13:13:16 <banas> it was for me, it was for many other folk too, and it went well in first year. they;'re the tech clubbers you know.
13:13:16 <nikam> Yeah, Linux - dat too in first week?  So we move on with the next topic?
13:13:40 <romil931> I think so too. Counselling over right. What rank did it go till this time?
13:13:42 <vishaag> 10k
13:13:45 <ahuja_> maybe we could do it like an official "Welcome to the cs dept" thing, is what sambhav is trying to say. And while doing that, put in a little bit about tknow
13:14:15 <banas> ahuja_: I won't go against that, but you need to make it sound cooler :D
13:14:31 <banas> and wai
13:14:37 <dultinator> Hi, what did I miss?
13:14:43 <Z_E_U_S> a lot
13:14:49 <banas> is your tshirt discussion over or not? I really want clean summaries
13:15:09 <dultinator> Wait. Even t-shirt discussion isnt over?
13:15:10 <nikam> we're paying for the induction and looting them in the workshop :p
13:15:47 <banas> #topic Raising funds for promo stuff
13:15:48 <romil931> We might have a better crowd this time. In the sense of people interested to do things.
13:15:48 <Z_E_U_S> its always about getting there early thats y i was saying have a linux thing as soon as possible
13:16:17 * banas needs a doze of hershey's, will brb
13:16:20 <nikam> ok, one final time - are we we are going for the tshirts? We pay for them if yes.
13:16:38 <banas> #undo
13:16:38 <glitterfox> Removing item from minutes: <MeetBot.ircmeeting.items.Topic object at 0x16bb7d0>
13:17:30 <Z_E_U_S> personally i think t shirts are a bit too over the top sometimes
13:18:00 <banas> ok, here's what i suggest again
13:18:08 <banas> keep the primary swag to be something else - cap/band/sticker
13:18:15 <banas> thats what everybody organizing gets
13:18:27 <banas> how to pay for it - you figure that out later
13:18:44 <Z_E_U_S> each one pays for his own right
13:18:46 <romil931> Do the bands now.
13:18:49 <banas> as for tshirts, do a count of who wants it, print that money, and whoever wants one pays for it
13:18:55 <romil931> We will do shirts for induction
13:19:18 <banas> s/money/many
13:19:23 <nikam> yes, we'll go ahead with a count
13:19:40 <banas> yes do a count
13:19:44 <banas> but later bwhen everyone is there
13:19:53 <Z_E_U_S> guys i think we are thinking too much about something as unimportant as a shirt
13:20:01 <banas> +1
13:20:12 <Z_E_U_S> other things are more important
13:20:13 <nikam> + 1
13:20:21 <banas> ok, moving on
13:20:27 <banas> #topic Ahuja's skit
13:20:42 <amaragayathri> sorry, got to go. An important wedding ! I'll check out the logs later :)
13:20:47 <nikam> ahuja_ : you there?
13:20:52 <Z_E_U_S> abi?
13:20:53 <banas> amaragayathri: sure, thanks for coming! :)

13:21:03 <Z_E_U_S> bye*
13:21:06 <nikam> Yeah, thanks :)
13:21:36 * banas thinks we should wait a while for ahuja?
13:21:38 <ahuja_> heyo
13:21:44 <amaragayathri> you shouldnt say that ppl..come on..we are a crew !! :D
13:21:45 <Z_E_U_S> yo

13:21:58 <banas> great
13:22:05 <banas> ahuja_: fill us in!
13:22:07 <banas> :D
13:22:17 <nikam> your skit? :p
13:22:20 <ahuja_> Now I've read a few stallman essays
13:22:46 <ahuja_> and been uncovering some archives from since wikileaks started happening
13:23:07 <ahuja_> I've been highlighting stuff that I feel is stimulating
13:23:30 <ahuja_> things that talk about technology in a manner that makes it human
13:23:33 <Z_E_U_S> remember we need to appeal to school kids here right
13:23:34 <ahuja_> for instance
13:23:50 <ahuja_> yes, I shall keep that in mind
13:23:56 <Z_E_U_S> :)
13:24:01 <ahuja_> for instance, skim through this
13:24:03 <ahuja_> magnet:?xt=urn:btih:77352569fa89e2e6807de81235c8b0e2b376db2d&dn=The.Sweetest.Thing.2002.DVDRip.Xvid-Nile&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.publicbt.com%3A80&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.istole.it%3A6969&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337
13:24:05 * banas goes to look for the rms talk at fudcon beijing
13:24:08 <ahuja_> sorry sorry
13:24:39 <ahuja_> this->>
13:24:40 <ahuja_> And they developed other traditions such as getting Chinese food at three in the morning. And I remember many sunrises seen from a car coming back from Chinatown. It was actually a very beautiful thing to see a sunrise, cause' that's such a calm time of day. It's a wonderful time of day to get ready to go to bed.
13:26:42 <ahuja> disconnected. AND I'M BACK
13:27:10 <Z_E_U_S> my connection vows have started too
13:27:17 <Z_E_U_S> what did i miss?
13:27:20 <nikam> ahuja: So you have a play in mind?
13:27:30 <ahuja> i have ideas
13:27:33 <ahuja> not a script
13:27:39 <nikam> How many members do yoiu need for it? approx ?
13:28:01 <vishaag> We could refer the movie 'Revolution OS' for that play!
13:28:10 <ahuja> I'm working on some models, trying to see whether a TBBT approach would keep the audience occupied
13:28:28 <ahuja> how many, say 6?
13:28:48 <banas> +1 to what vishaag says, although i feel it could feel dry for new folk
13:28:52 <ahuja> too many would make it messy i feel
13:29:00 <nikam> And you need practice, time etc So you need your crew to be ready with scripts by the time we start college
13:29:02 <romil931> @ahuja talk to anirudh to generate a script
13:29:10 <ahuja> ok
13:29:32 <romil931> He will have inputs to make it interesting as well.
13:29:40 <ahuja> yes, a script should be ready by the time college opens, I'll keep that deadline
13:29:56 <ahuja> romil931: cool!
13:30:24 <ahuja> There's just so many things that have happened recently
13:30:25 <nikam> hey, me and sambhav were thinking to using dults idea - of some one typing comments at the back?
13:30:30 <ahuja> SOPA/PIPA
13:30:40 <nikam> ahuja: that would be great :)
13:30:52 <ahuja> ...Aaron Swartz, censorship

13:31:19 <Z_E_U_S> ahuja: try to have some good comic timing in the play mate
13:31:30 <Z_E_U_S> nikam: i agree
13:31:36 <Z_E_U_S> it was too gud
13:32:02 <nikam> romil931 : can dult do it again?
13:32:23 <romil931> I dunno you have to ask him only.
